["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.

``` python
def hello():
    return 'Hello, World!'
```

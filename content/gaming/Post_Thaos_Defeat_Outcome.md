in pillars of eternity what happens after you defeat thaos
## assistant

After you defeat **Thaos ix Arkannon** in *Pillars of Eternity*, the story enters its **epilogue phase**, and what happens depends heavily on your choices throughout the game. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

---

### **1. Immediate Aftermath**
- **Thaos' Soul and the Machine**: Once Thaos is defeated in Sun in Shadow, you gain control of his soul and the giant adra machine he was using to funnel souls back to **Woedica's plan**.
- You can decide what happens to the souls Thaos was manipulating:
  - **Return to the Wheel** (the natural reincarnation cycle).
  - **Send to the gods** (different gods favor this).
  - **Disperse or redirect** (some choices let you send souls to specific causes).

---

### **2. Thaos’ Fate**
- You get a conversation with Thaos’ soul, where he admits his reasoning and fears. You can be merciful or condemn him before he’s finally gone forever.

---

### **3. Your Watcher Condition**
- Throughout the game, you’ve been plagued by visions and mental degradation due to your awakening.
- After Thaos dies, the bond that caused your deterioration is broken, but your soul remains permanently **awakened**—you’ll never be entirely “normal.”
- The visions and voices stop, though.

---

### **4. The Epilogue Slides**
- The game gives you **text-based ending slides** (like classic *Baldur’s Gate* or *Fallout*).
- These describe:
  - **What happens to the major factions** (*Defiance Bay*, *Dyrwood*, *White March* if you have that DLC).
  - **The fate of your companions**, based on your interactions and their quests.
  - **Your own legacy**, depending on big choices (what you did with the souls, how you treated people, alliances, etc.).

---

### **5. The Ending Themes**
- The ultimate point is about **faith, lies, and autonomy**:
  - You’ve uncovered that the gods were **constructed by the Engwithans**, and all faith in them is based on that secret.
  - The game never forces you to reveal this to the world; you can keep it hidden or share the truth in certain dialogue.

---

### **6. Transition to Deadfire**
If you plan to play *Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire*:
- Your key choices **carry over**, such as:
  - Fate of the souls at Sun in Shadow.
  - How you handled major factions.
  - Some companion fates.
- This influences Deadfire’s story (and dialogue references).

---

Do you want me to **list all the major soul-ending options** and what each means for the world? Or should I break down **companion endings** (Eder, Aloth, Durance, etc.)?
## user
so where do i start the dlc
## assistant
In the original *Pillars of Eternity* (not Deadfire), the main DLCs are **The White March Part I & II**. Here’s how and when to start them:

---

### ✅ **Where and How to Start The White March DLC**
- After reaching **Caed Nua** (your stronghold), you will eventually receive a **letter about trouble in the White March**.
- This triggers a quest: **“The White March, Part I.”**
- The messenger appears in your stronghold after **Act II starts** (once you resolve the main Defiance Bay story and reach Twin Elms OR after reaching level 7+).
- The letter invites you to **Stalwart Village**, the hub for the DLC.

---

### ✅ **Recommended Level**
- **White March Part I**: Level **7–9** (early Act II).
- **White March Part II**: Level **12–14** (late Act II or Act III).
- If you start too early, the DLC will **auto-scale**, but it’s still challenging.

---

### ✅ **Traveling to the White March**
- After you accept the quest, **Stalwart Village** will appear on your world map (north of the Dyrwood).
- You can go there any time after the quest is active.

---

### ✅ **Story Integration**
- The DLC content runs **parallel to the main story**, so:
  - Do **Part I** during Act II or early Act III.
  - Do **Part II** after completing Part I (but before finishing the game, because post-Thaos is just epilogue).

---

Do you want me to **map the ideal order of quests** for a smooth experience (main story + both White March parts)? Or a **level-by-level progression guide** so you don’t miss anything?
## user
can i go back to caed nua from sun in shadow
## assistant
No—you **cannot return to Caed Nua or the world map after you enter Sun in Shadow**. That point is considered the **point of no return**.

Here’s how it works:

- When you step into **Sun in Shadow** (through Teir Evron after the council), the game warns you that this is the **final area**.
- After you defeat Thaos, the game immediately goes to the **ending slides** and then credits.  
- There is **no post-game free roam** in *Pillars of Eternity 1* (unlike Deadfire).

---

### ✅ So what to do before entering Sun in Shadow:
- **Finish any side quests** you care about.
- Complete **The White March Parts I & II**, because you can’t start them after Thaos.
- Upgrade Caed Nua if you want its ending slide to reflect your choices.
- Talk to all companions for their final dialogue.

---

If you’re standing right at Sun in Shadow’s entrance and want the DLC, you’ll have to **reload an earlier save** (before the final confrontation).  

Do you want me to give you a **checklist of everything worth finishing before Sun in Shadow** so you don’t miss any content?

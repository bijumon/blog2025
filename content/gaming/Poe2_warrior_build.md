For a Fighter/Swashbuckler build in *Pillars of Eternity II*, focusing on a balanced mix of durability, offense, and versatility can help you maximize this multi-class's potential. Let’s break down the ideal skill setup for your active and passive skills.

### Active Skills
1. **Athletics** – This is crucial for a Fighter/Swashbuckler because it improves your Second Wind, a self-healing ability that’s incredibly helpful to keep you alive in prolonged melee engagements. Aim to get at least a moderate level in Athletics for more frequent use of Second Wind.
  
2. **Alchemy** – Alchemy can be quite useful, especially if you want to maximize the impact of consumables like healing potions or bombs. While you don’t need to focus heavily here, a few points in Alchemy can significantly enhance the effectiveness of potions and poisons, which can complement the Swashbuckler’s damage output.

3. **Mechanics** – If you're planning to make your Swashbuckler capable of handling traps and locks, Mechanics is worth investing in. It’s especially helpful if you don’t have a dedicated rogue in your party to handle these tasks.

For a Fighter/Swashbuckler build in *Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire*, the skill choices complement the hybrid playstyle of a Fighter and Rogue (Swashbuckler). This blend excels in melee combat, balancing durability, mobility, and strong single-target damage. Here’s a breakdown of recommended skills to help support this build's potential.

### Active Skills
For a Fighter/Swashbuckler, these active skills bolster your combat prowess and survivability in tough fights:

1. **Athletics** – *High Priority*
   - Boosts your character’s Second Wind ability, providing in-combat healing. With a Fighter's natural resilience and potential front-line role, this is essential for recovering quickly from damage in tougher fights.
   - Aim for around 8-10 points to maximize Second Wind’s potency in mid-to-late game without heavily investing in healing items.

2. **Alchemy** – *Moderate Priority*
   - While not as crucial as Athletics, Alchemy enhances the potency of consumables, including potions and bombs, which can offer an edge in challenging battles.
   - If you plan to use poisons on your weapons, Alchemy further boosts their effectiveness, letting you capitalize on the Swashbuckler’s high critical hit chance.
   - Aiming for around 4-6 points provides a nice balance without overspending, as your role focuses more on direct combat.

3. **Stealth** – *Situational*
   - The Rogue side of the Swashbuckler benefits from Stealth for an initial sneak attack or flanking move, especially useful if you want to start fights by catching enemies off-guard.
   - However, Fighters don’t necessarily need high Stealth in combat-heavy settings, so invest minimally here unless you plan to play a more tactical, positioning-heavy style.

### Passive Skills
Passive skills can elevate a Fighter/Swashbuckler’s effectiveness by boosting damage, defense, or utility:

1. **Survival** – *Moderate Priority*
   - Useful for increasing Resting Bonuses, which can provide nice boosts like extra Health, Damage, or Armor for specific zones.
   - If your focus is on high DPS, look for Survival bonuses that increase damage in specific environments where your character will often fight.
   - Around 4-6 points should be sufficient to provide helpful but not critical bonuses.

2. **Insight (Diplomacy)** – *Moderate Priority*
   - While not directly combat-related, Insight improves dialogue checks and can offer ways to avoid conflict or gain additional rewards. 
   - Aim for 3-4 points to cover the basics without detracting too much from combat-oriented skills.

3. **History (Lore)** – *Low Priority*
   - Not essential for a Swashbuckler, but Lore can help you use scrolls in combat, adding flexibility. While it’s not a priority, consider a few points if you occasionally use scrolls for ranged or AOE abilities.
   - For a Swashbuckler, 2-4 points should be enough if you want scroll access without making it a focal point.

### Summary of Skill Allocation:
For a Fighter/Swashbuckler build:
- **High Priority**: Athletics
- **Moderate Priority**: Alchemy, Survival, Insight
- **Low Priority**: Stealth (for tactical flanking), History (for occasional scroll use)

Balancing between Athletics for Second Wind, Alchemy for consumables, and a mix of passive utility skills helps create a well-rounded and effective Fighter/Swashbuckler, whether you’re focused on tanking, damage, or versatility in encounters.

1. **Disciplined Barrage**: Essential for early fights. Boosts accuracy, leading to more consistent hits and crits.
2. **Knock Down**: Excellent crowd control to keep enemies vulnerable and disrupt their attacks.
3. **Fighter Stances**: Switch between **Defensive Stance** (for tanking) and **Cleaving Stance** (for added offense).
4. **Confident Aim**: Ensures minimum damage is higher, leading to more consistent hits.
5. **Charge**: Great for reaching ranged enemies quickly or repositioning when needed.
6. **Unbending** (Unbending Trunk later): Provides a percentage of damage as health restoration, crucial for sustaining in prolonged fights.
7. **Armored Grace**: Reduces the recovery penalty of armor, so you stay mobile.
8. **Unbreakable**: Provides a second chance if you’re downed, adding an extra layer of resilience.

#### **Rogue Abilities**
1. **Crippling Strike**: Good damage with a debuff, very helpful for locking down priority targets.
2. **Sneak Attack**: Passive boost to your opening attacks when enemies are flanked, making the initial strikes harder-hitting.
3. **Escape**: Lets you reposition if you’re surrounded or need to retreat.
4. **Blinding Strike**: Deals good damage and debuffs the enemy’s accuracy.
5. **Dirty Fighting**: Increases your chance to critically hit—synergizes well with high Perception and Dexterity.
6. **Finishing Blow**: Devastating attack on enemies with low health, helping end fights quicker.
7. **Persistent Distraction**: Pairs well with Sneak Attack by flanking enemies automatically, increasing your damage output.
8. **Deathblows**: Adds bonus damage when you’ve applied two debuffs to an enemy, maximizing your burst potential.

#### **Suggested Combo**
   - Start with **Disciplined Barrage** for accuracy, then open with **Crippling Strike** to apply debuffs, which primes the enemy for a **Sneak Attack**.
   - Use **Blinding Strike** or **Knock Down** if you need additional control, and follow up with **Finishing Blow** when enemies are low.

### **3. Equipment and Weapons**

- **Weapons**: Dual-wield for fast, high-damage combos. Options like **dual sabres** or **rapier and dagger** offer good DPS and synergy with the rogue's skills.

   - **Athletics**: A few points are crucial for **Second Wind**, which gives you a heal-on-demand for emergencies.
   - **Alchemy**: Useful for boosting the effectiveness of potions, particularly for buffs and healing.
   - **Explosives**: Optional but can add versatility by giving you a ranged option to open fights or control groups.

#### **Passive Skills**
   - **Stealth**: Not a priority since you’re more frontline-focused, but a few points can help initiate with a Sneak Attack.
   - **Survival**: Grants useful bonuses like increased health received from consumables or reduced duration of status effects.

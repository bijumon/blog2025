To win a *Religious Victory* as **Peter of Russia** with **Hagia Sophia** and **Theocracy**, here's a strong and focused strategy based on the manual and the unique strengths of Russia:

---

### 🌟 Overall Victory Goal
To achieve a Religious Victory, **your religion must become the predominant religion in every civilization** in the game—this means it must be followed by more than 50% of the cities in each civilization【8:0†2KGMKT_CIV6_25TH_EXT_MANUAL.pdf】.

---

### 🧍 Why Peter of Russia?
Peter's strengths:
- **Mother Russia ability** gives you extra Faith from tundra tiles—useful for early Holy Sites.
- **Lavras** (unique Holy Site replacement) are cheaper and grant Great Prophet points more efficiently—crucial for founding a religion early.

---

### 🛕 Build Order and Infrastructure

1. **Scout → Builder → Settler**
   - Prioritize discovering city-states and Natural Wonders for bonus Faith.

2. **Early Holy Site (Lavras)**
   - Build them early and frequently; tundra adjacency bonus is significant.

3. **Shrine + Temple ASAP**
   - This unlocks **Missionaries** (from Shrine) and **Apostles** (from Temple)【8:6†2KGMKT_CIV6_25TH_EXT_MANUAL.pdf】.

4. **Hagia Sophia Wonder**
   - Must-build Wonder: **grants +1 spread religion charge to all Missionaries and Apostles**.
   - Build it in a city with strong production and religious infrastructure.

5. **Theocracy Government**
   - This government lets you **buy land units with Faith** and **gives a Faith discount on religious purchases**【8:8†2KGMKT_CIV6_25TH_EXT_MANUAL.pdf】.
   - Slot **Wildcard policies** that boost Faith, Great Person generation, or religious combat.

---

### ✝️ Religious Spread Strategy

- **Missionaries**: Use to convert cities passively.
- **Apostles**: Use for aggressive spreads and **Theological Combat** (to eliminate rival religious units).
- **Inquisitors**: Cleanse your cities from other religions after declaring an Inquisition with an Apostle.

---

### 🧠 Beliefs to Choose (when founding your religion)

1. **Follower Belief**: “Work Ethic” or “Religious Community” for growth or production bonuses.
2. **Founder Belief**: “Tithe” (Gold from followers) or “Church Property” for economic sustainability.
3. **Enhancer**: “Missionary Zeal” (no movement penalty) or “Holy Order” (cheaper units).
4. **Worship Belief**: Choose the building that synergizes with Lavras.

---

### ⚔️ Additional Tips

- Use Theological Combat aggressively: defeat enemy Apostles to reduce rival religious influence.
- Target religious city-states for extra Faith.
- Watch out for Enlightenment (Civic): it reduces tourism from religion, but not religion spread itself.
- Maintain diplomatic balance to avoid unnecessary wars that distract from your religious mission.

For **Peter of Russia** pursuing a **Religious Victory**, the best **Pantheon** choices synergize with his strengths (Faith from tundra, Lavras, early expansion). Here are the **top Pantheon picks** for your strategy:

---

### 🥇 **Religious Settlements**
- **Effect**: Border expansion rate is 15% faster.
- **Why it’s great**: Lets you **claim key tiles early**, especially tundra or resource-heavy spots near Holy Sites. Synergizes with Russia’s extra territory from settling.

---

### 🥈 **Dance of the Aurora**
- **Effect**: Holy Site districts get **+1 Faith from adjacent Tundra tiles**.
- **Why it’s powerful**: This is **Russia’s signature combo**. Lavras built near tundra tiles with this Pantheon will yield **insane Faith early**, snowballing your religious spread.

---

### 🥉 **Divine Spark**
- **Effect**: +1 Great Person Point from Holy Sites (Prophets), Campuses (Scientists), and Theaters (Writers).
- **Why it’s useful**: Guarantees you’ll **found a religion quickly** and continue generating Great Prophets and other Great People.

---

### Honorable Mentions
- **God of the Open Sky** (if you’re in pastures-heavy terrain).
- **God of the Sea** (on coastal maps with lots of sea resources).
- **Earth Goddess** (if you have many high-Appeal tiles for passive Faith).

---

### 🔥 Best Choice for You: **Dance of the Aurora**
If you're settling in or near tundra (as Russia is designed to), this is **your best option**, especially when paired with Lavras. It can fuel explosive early Faith output and secure an unstoppable religious lead.

which beliefs to choose as peter with lavra
## assistant
As **Peter of Russia** with **Lavras**, your religion can dominate if you select beliefs that:

- Amplify your **Faith output**
- Empower **missionary/apostle use**
- Convert cities **faster and cheaper**
- Sustain your empire’s **economy and growth**

Here’s the optimal belief setup tailored for Lavra and religious victory:

---

### 🔮 **Best Beliefs for Peter’s Religious Victory**

#### 🧍‍♂️ **Follower Belief – Work Ethic** *(Top Priority)*
- **Effect**: +1% Production for each follower in a city.
- **Why**: With Lavras boosting Faith, your cities will be full of followers—this belief turns that into **massive production** for Wonders, units, or buildings.

---

#### 👑 **Founder Belief – Tithe** or **Church Property**
- **Tithe**: +1 Gold for every 4 followers of this religion in foreign cities.
- **Church Property**: +2 Gold for each city following your religion.
- **Why**: Both help finance your religious units and infrastructure. **Tithe** scales better in wide conversions, **Church Property** is simpler and reliable.

---

#### ✝️ **Enhancer Belief – Holy Order** or **Missionary Zeal**
- **Holy Order**: Missionaries and Apostles are 30% cheaper to purchase.
- **Missionary Zeal**: Religious units ignore movement penalties on terrain and features.
- **Why**:
  - **Holy Order** gives you **more units faster**, perfect for Lavra-fueled economies.
  - **Missionary Zeal** is better on rough maps or large continents for aggressive spreading.

---

#### ⛪ **Worship Belief – Cathedral** or **Meeting House**
- **Cathedral**: +3 Faith and holds Great Works of Art.
- **Meeting House**: +3 Faith and +2 Production.
- **Why**: **Cathedral** boosts both Faith and Culture (especially if going cultural hybrid), **Meeting House** synergizes better with **Work Ethic** and production-based play.

---

### 🧠 Summary Build (Optimal for Peter)
- **Pantheon**: Dance of the Aurora
- **Follower**: Work Ethic
- **Founder**: Tithe
- **Enhancer**: Holy Order
- **Worship**: Meeting House

---

This combo gives you:
- High Faith output from tundra Lavras
- Fast and cheap religious unit production
- Scalable gold economy from conversions
- Strong production via followers (Work Ethic + Meeting House)

Let me know if you're on a different map type or facing early war pressure—those can slightly change the ideal setup.

Russia is one of the strongest civilizations in *Civilization VI* for
pursuing a **Religious Victory**, thanks to its unmatched early Faith
generation and powerful Lavra district. With the right pantheon, belief
choices, and timing, Peter can snowball Faith into production, gold,
wonders, and unstoppable Apostle waves. This guide explains how to build
that momentum from the early game to the final conversion campaign.

## Russia Excels at Religion

Russia's kit naturally pushes you toward a religious playstyle. **Mother
Russia** gives extra territory and Faith from tundra tiles, making even
harsh climates profitable. The **Lavra**, which replaces the Holy Site,
provides additional Great Prophet points and gains exceptional adjacency
from tundra---especially with Dance of the Aurora. This allows Russia to
secure a religion even in contested games and to generate enough Faith
to dominate the medieval and renaissance eras.

## Gameplan

1.  Generate huge early Faith through tundra-adjacent Lavras.\
2.  Secure a quick religion and stack beliefs that discount units, boost
    production, and scale economy.\
3.  Transition into Theocracy, where Faith becomes your main resource
    for purchasing Apostles and even land units.\
4.  Outspread and outfight rival religions using enhanced Apostles, high
    charges from Hagia Sophia, and theological combat.\
5.  Sweep continents by converting every civ's majority cities before
    they can react.

## City Expansion

Settle near tundra - not fully in it, but close enough to give Lavras
3 to 6 tundra adjacency tiles. Russia's extra starting territory and the
**Religious Settlements** pantheon can help you claim critical tiles
early. Balanced placement ensures good growth while maximizing
adjacency.

Look for: - Tundra with forests
- Natural Wonders that give Faith
- High-production cities for wonder building

## Beliefs & Pantheon

### Pantheon -- Dance of the Aurora
Lavras receive +1 Faith for every adjacent tundra tile, dramatically
boosting early Faith.

### Follower Belief -- Work Ethic
Transforms religious followers into production, enabling fast wonder
construction and infrastructure.

### Founder Belief -- Tithe or Church Property
Both sustain your gold economy as your religion spreads.

### Enhancer Belief -- Holy Order or Missionary Zeal
Holy Order is generally better for Russia, multiplying Faith efficiency.

### Worship Belief -- Meeting House
+3 Faith and +2 Production, synergizing well with Work Ethic.

## Early Turns 1-80
-   Scout → Builder → Settler\
-   Build Lavras early with strong tundra adjacency\
-   Construct Shrine → Temple\
-   Claim religious city-state bonuses early\
-   Secure Great Prophet quickly

## Mid Turns 80-150
### Hagia Sophia
Priority wonder for extra spread charges on Missionaries and Apostles.

### Theocracy Government
Discounted Faith purchases and wildcard slots empower your religious
engine. Train Apostles with promotions like Debater, Translator, Pilgrim, 
or Proselytizer.

## Late Turns 150+

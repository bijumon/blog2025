##  In-Game Context & Tips for These Achievements

Fandom’s OPUS Wiki provides more context on how to achieve many of these secrets and their triggers citeturn0search3:

- **Clan Edict achievements**: These are tied to key dialogue choices:
  - *Hide No Secret*: Decline to send the letter.
  - *Leave None Behind*: Choose to help Bones with injuries.
  - *Tell No Lies*: Be honest to Eda.
  - *Hold No Grudges*: Thank Remi after being rescued.
  - *Point No Fingers*: Trust Remi after mishaps.
  - *Covet No Rewards*: Let Eda decide your fate.
  - *Fear No Danger*: Refuse Kay’s advice to just sit and watch.
  - *Act Not Through Others*: Go after Eda yourself.

- **Die! Die! Die!**: Throw darts 10 times at the dart board during the forged visa crafting scene citeturn0search3.

- **Remi, prepare for landing!** (not secret) and **Dodge that, Remi!** (not secret) are performance-based, but several hidden ones align with similar avoid-failure challenges—like *East Ocean Noble* and *The Witch*.

- **Flawless Memory**, **The Witch**, **East Ocean Noble**, and **In a Flash** have technical nuances: you must *not fail or die* (for the first two), complete puzzles flawlessly (*East Ocean Noble*), or finish the game swiftly (*In a Flash*). Fandom notes there’s a glitch: if you fail near the end, you can load a pre-failure save and proceed directly to the ending to still unlock them citeturn0search3.

To get **100% achievements** in *Opus: Echo of Starsong* on your second playthrough, you need a structured approach because some are **mutually exclusive choices** and some require **perfect runs**. Here’s a plan that covers everything efficiently:

---

## ✅ **Step 1: Prepare for Second Playthrough**
- **First run goal**: Finish the story casually, enjoy the narrative, and make any choices you like. This unlocks a good chunk of achievements and familiarizes you with puzzles.
- **Second run goal**: Optimize for **speed**, **perfection**, and **specific dialogue choices**.

---

## ✅ **Step 2: Core Principles for Second Run**
- **Play on Normal difficulty** (no need for Easy unless struggling).
- **Save strategically**: Before major dialogue decisions and key scenes, so you can reload if needed.
- **Skip unnecessary exploration** unless it’s for achievements.
- **Use guide notes for puzzles**: You need flawless East Ocean puzzle completion.

---

## ✅ **Step 3: Route for All Hidden Achievements**
Here’s a **condensed roadmap** to combine everything in one efficient playthrough:

---

### **A. Clan Edict Choices (8 Hidden Achievements)**
Do all correct choices in a single run:
1. **Hide No Secret** – Do **NOT** send the letter.
2. **Leave None Behind** – Help Bones when given the option.
3. **Tell No Lies** – Be honest to Eda when she asks.
4. **Hold No Grudges** – Thank Remi after rescue.
5. **Point No Fingers** – Trust Remi after mishap.
6. **Covet No Rewards** – Let Eda decide about the reward.
7. **Fear No Danger** – Ignore Kay’s advice to stay put.
8. **Act Not Through Others** – Go after Eda personally.

✅ These are all dialogue-driven; just follow this order when they appear.

---

### **B. Performance Achievements**
- **Flawless Memory** – Do **not fail** at any point.
    - Save before dangerous sections.
    - If you fail, reload immediately.
- **The Witch** – Never resonate with the wrong starsong.
    - Double-check notes before playing a melody.
- **East Ocean Noble** – Solve all East Ocean puzzles **without mistakes**.
    - These are the “beam routing” puzzles. Write down solutions or look them up.
- **In a Flash** – Complete the game in **under 8 hours**.
    - Skip unnecessary dialogue using fast-forward.
    - Stick to the main story route.
    - Use auto-path when possible.

### **D. Non-Secret But Common Missables**
- **Remi, prepare for landing!** and **Dodge that, Remi!** – Avoid hits during QTE sequences.

---

## ✅ **Save Strategy**

---

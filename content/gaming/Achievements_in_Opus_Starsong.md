OPUS Wiki provides more context on how to achieve many of these secrets and their triggers

**Clan Edict achievements**: These are tied to key dialogue choices:
  - *Hide No Secret*: Decline to send the letter.
  - *Leave None Behind*: Choose to help Bones with injuries.
  - *Tell No Lies*: Be honest to Eda.
  - *Hold No Grudges*: Thank Remi after being rescued.
  - *Point No Fingers*: Trust Remi after mishaps.
  - *Covet No Rewards*: Let Eda decide your fate.
  - *Fear No Danger*: Refuse Kay’s advice to just sit and watch.
  - *Act Not Through Others*: Go after Eda yourself.

**Die! Die! Die!**: Throw darts 10 times at the dart board during the forged visa crafting scene

**Remi, prepare for landing!** (not secret) and **Dodge that, Remi!** (not secret) are performance-based, but several hidden ones align with similar avoid-failure challenges—like *East Ocean Noble* and *The Witch*.

**Flawless Memory**, **The Witch**, **East Ocean Noble**, and **In a Flash** have technical nuances: you must *not fail or die* (for the first two), complete puzzles flawlessly (*East Ocean Noble*), or finish the game swiftly (*In a Flash*). Fandom notes there’s a glitch: if you fail near the end, you can load a pre-failure save and proceed directly to the ending to still unlock them citeturn0search3.

**Second Run**
- **Play on Normal difficulty** (no need for Easy unless struggling).
- **Save strategically**: Before major dialogue decisions and key scenes, so you can reload if needed.
- **Skip unnecessary exploration** unless it’s for achievements.
- **Use guide notes for puzzles**: You need flawless East Ocean puzzle completion.

**Clan Edict Choices (8 Hidden Achievements)**
Do all correct choices in a single run:
1. **Hide No Secret** – Do **NOT** send the letter.
2. **Leave None Behind** – Help Bones when given the option.
3. **Tell No Lies** – Be honest to Eda when she asks.
4. **Hold No Grudges** – Thank Remi after rescue.
5. **Point No Fingers** – Trust Remi after mishap.
6. **Covet No Rewards** – Let Eda decide about the reward.
7. **Fear No Danger** – Ignore Kay’s advice to stay put.
8. **Act Not Through Others** – Go after Eda personally.

These are all dialogue-driven; just follow this order when they appear.

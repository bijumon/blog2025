## assistant

For *Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire*, Barbarian builds focus on high damage and tanky survivability, excelling in close-combat and crowd control. Here’s a detailed Barbarian build to give you a powerful character for melee-heavy battles.

### Class Overview: Barbarian
Barbarians thrive on dealing AoE damage and taking hits, so we want a build that maximizes survivability, aggression, and synergy with other party members. For this build, we’ll focus on:
- **High damage output** with melee weapons
- **Durability** to sustain in melee range
- **AoE potential** to clear groups of enemies efficiently

---

### Build: **The Juggernaut Barbarian**
This build focuses on high AoE damage, self-sustain, and debuffing enemies. It’s a straightforward Barbarian build that can wade into crowds, dealing devastating AoE damage and sustaining itself through constant fighting.

#### Subclass: **Berserker**
- **Berserker** subclass is a top choice because of the Frenzy ability, which adds more damage and grants a passive healing effect while frenzied.
- **Downside**: It makes you vulnerable to receiving raw damage and debuffs while frenzied, so you’ll need to manage that with gear and tactics.

#### Race: **Human** (for Fighting Spirit) or **Orlan** (for Deflection)
- **Human** is a good choice because Fighting Spirit triggers when you’re below half health, giving +7 Accuracy and +15% Damage for 10 seconds.
- **Orlan** works if you prefer a Deflection boost to mitigate incoming attacks.

---

### Attributes
Attributes play a key role in Barbarian effectiveness. Here’s a suggested distribution:
- **Might**: 18+ (Core for Barbarian’s damage)
- **Constitution**: 14+ (Enhances durability)
- **Dexterity**: 10+ (Optional; improves attack speed but not vital for this build)
- **Perception**: 10-14 (Useful to hit often and avoid missing key attacks)
- **Intellect**: 10-12 (Increases AoE range for Carnage, making you effective against groups)
- **Resolve**: 8-10 (Not essential, but don’t dump too low as you’ll need some resistance to interrupts)

---

### Abilities Progression
Focus on Barbarian abilities that enhance damage, AoE, and survivability.

1. **Level 1: Frenzy** - Increases Might, Constitution, and Attack Speed. Adds raw damage vulnerability.
2. **Level 2: Blooded** - Adds a damage bonus when below 50% health.
3. **Level 3: Barbaric Yell** - Useful for debuffing enemies by frightening them.
4. **Level 4: Thick-Skinned** - Provides bonuses to Armor Rating against Slash and Piercing, countering Frenzy vulnerability.
5. **Level 5: Barbaric Blow** - Powerful single-target ability with high damage potential.
6. **Level 6: Bloodlust** - Boosts Action Speed if you’ve recently killed an enemy, great for chaining kills.
7. **Level 7: One Stands Alone** - Increases melee damage when surrounded, perfect for crowd control.
8. **Level 8: Blood Thirst** - Reduces Recovery Time after killing, allowing you to stay on the attack.
9. **Level 9: Barbaric Shout** - Mass AoE frighten effect, useful for control.
10. **Level 10+: Greater Frenzy, Heart of Fury, etc.** - Go for upgrades to Frenzy and multi-target damage abilities.

#### Multiclass Option: **Barbarian / Fighter**
Pairing Barbarian with Fighter provides even more durability and a defensive skill set to complement Barbarian’s aggression. You can take Fighter’s **Tactical Barrage** and **Unbending** for self-healing.

---

### Equipment
For a Barbarian, focus on weapons that hit hard and armor that balances speed with protection.

#### Weapons
- **Dual Wield**: Dual sabres or axes for high DPS; ideal for taking out enemies quickly.
- **Two-Handed**: Great Sword or Estoc if you prefer harder-hitting, slower strikes.
  
#### Armor
- **Medium Armor**: Something like Scale or Breastplate provides a good balance between mobility and protection.
- **Enchants**: Go for ones that boost Might, Constitution, and damage bonuses.

---

### Party Synergy
Since Barbarians are melee-centric, they benefit from party support:
- **Priest** or **Druid** with healing/buff spells like **Blessing** and **Consecrated Ground**.
- **Chanter** for passive health regeneration and resistance to interrupts.
- **Wizard** with debuffs or AoE control to keep enemies grouped for Barbarian’s AoE attacks.

---

### Strategy Tips
- **Frenzy Wisely**: Activate Frenzy when you’re in a safe spot to avoid excessive damage from raw attacks.
- **Use Bloodlust and Blood Thirst**: These abilities help chain kills and keep the Barbarian aggressive and hard-hitting.
- **Group Enemies Together**: Barbarian thrives with Carnage against grouped enemies. Position well to maximize AoE.

This build will let you take on groups with reckless abandon, sustaining through self-healing and outputting damage across multiple targets. It’s effective and straightforward, making it perfect for a barbaric approach to combat.

Here’s a guide to selecting active and passive skills for a Barbarian in *Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire*, with an emphasis on high AoE damage, self-sustain, and crowd control.

---

### Core Active Skills
Active skills are essential for triggering high damage and managing crowd control. Here’s a level-by-level breakdown of recommended actives:

1. **Level 1 - Frenzy**
   - **Frenzy** is your core Barbarian skill, increasing Might, Constitution, and Action Speed while in a Frenzied state. It’s a strong damage and survivability boost.

2. **Level 3 - Barbaric Yell**
   - **Barbaric Yell** frightens enemies in a small area, reducing their effectiveness and making them vulnerable. This debuff is useful for controlling crowds and mitigating incoming damage.

3. **Level 5 - Barbaric Blow**
   - **Barbaric Blow** is a high-damage, single-target attack that generates a significant amount of damage and has a chance to refund its cost if it kills the target.

4. **Level 7 - One Stands Alone**
   - This ability increases your melee damage when surrounded by two or more enemies, boosting damage output when in thick combat.

5. **Level 9 - Barbaric Shout**
   - **Barbaric Shout** is a powerful AoE that frightens all enemies around you, a great way to reduce their offensive output and create space for your allies.

6. **Level 13 - Heart of Fury**
   - **Heart of Fury** is one of the best AoE Barbarian abilities, striking all nearby enemies for heavy damage and synergizing well with the AoE from Carnage.

7. **Level 15 - Greater Frenzy**
   - An upgraded version of Frenzy, **Greater Frenzy** further increases Might, Constitution, and Action Speed, amplifying your damage and resilience in prolonged fights.

---

### Core Passive Skills
Passive skills provide consistent benefits without active management. For Barbarian, prioritize passives that enhance AoE, survivability, and attack effectiveness:

1. **Level 2 - Blooded**
   - **Blooded** gives you a damage bonus when your health is below 50%, which is likely in prolonged battles. It’s a good fit for the “Juggernaut” theme and helps you stay aggressive when injured.

2. **Level 4 - Thick-Skinned**
   - This passive increases your Armor Rating against Slash and Pierce damage, countering the increased raw damage taken during Frenzy and improving survivability.

3. **Level 6 - Bloodlust**
   - **Bloodlust** increases Action Speed for a brief time after landing a killing blow. It synergizes well with Frenzy and AoE damage to keep you fast and aggressive when surrounded.

4. **Level 8 - Blood Thirst**
   - This skill reduces your Recovery Time after a kill, keeping you in the action and allowing faster successive attacks, great for clearing groups.

5. **Level 10 - Brute Force**
   - **Brute Force** lets you target Fortitude instead of Deflection when attacking, which is often lower for most enemies. This makes it easier to land hits on tougher foes.

6. **Level 12 - Unflinching**
   - **Unflinching** increases your resistance to Resolve Afflictions (e.g., Dazed, Stunned), allowing you to stay in the fight longer.

7. **Level 14 - Bloody Slaughter**
   - **Bloody Slaughter** increases damage against enemies near death and boosts your Crit chance, allowing you to finish off wounded enemies more effectively.

8. **Level 16 - Savage Defiance**
   - This ability is self-healing, providing strong sustain for situations where you’re taking heavy damage.

For your Barbarian in *Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire*, you'll want a mix of active and passive skills that complement your build's focus on melee combat, survivability, and occasional crowd control. These skills will help with self-sustain, boost combat effectiveness, and provide helpful utility both in and out of combat.

Here’s a breakdown of recommended active and passive skills for a Barbarian:

---

### Active Skills
1. **Athletics**: Primary Active Skill
   - **Reason**: Athletics allows you to use the **Second Wind** ability, which provides a health regeneration ability in battle. This is essential for a Barbarian who frequently takes damage in melee combat.
   - **Priority**: High. Keep investing in Athletics to increase the effectiveness of Second Wind, which scales with Athletics skill level. 

2. **Alchemy**: Secondary Active Skill
   - **Reason**: Alchemy enhances the effects of consumables, including potions and drugs. Higher Alchemy improves the potency of healing potions, attack buffs, or crowd control effects, which can be crucial for intense battles.
   - **Priority**: Medium. A few points in Alchemy can go a long way, especially for tougher fights where you need enhanced healing or damage.

3. **Explosives**: Optional for crowd control
   - **Reason**: Explosives can be helpful if you want an extra edge with ranged area attacks or stuns, although it’s less crucial for Barbarians who already excel at AoE.
   - **Priority**: Low. Only invest if you want the flexibility of grenades in your arsenal.

---

### Passive Skills
1. **Intimidate**: Primary Passive Skill
   - **Reason**: Intimidate fits the Barbarian’s persona and opens up additional dialogue options. It can also synergize with your crowd control abilities by allowing you to frighten enemies out of combat, fitting with Barbaric Yell and Shout.
   - **Priority**: High. Prioritize this if you want to lean into the role-playing side as a fierce Barbarian and enhance fear-based abilities.

2. **Survival**: Secondary Passive Skill
   - **Reason**: Survival provides bonuses like increased Rest bonuses, which can improve healing, damage resistance, and other beneficial effects based on your rest choice. It can also be useful for Barbarian characters who are exploring dangerous areas and may need extra resilience.
   - **Priority**: Medium to High. This skill is great for durability, and you can pick Rest bonuses to suit the toughest fights.

3. **Insight or Streetwise**: Tertiary Passive Skills
   - **Reason**: Insight gives you a sense of perception and wisdom in conversations, which can help avoid conflicts or make better strategic choices. Streetwise can be helpful if you plan to interact with factions in a way that requires cunning and deception.
   - **Priority**: Low to Medium. You don’t need to invest heavily; just a few points can unlock extra conversation options.

---

### Summary of Skills to Focus On
- **Primary Skills**: Athletics, Intimidate
- **Secondary Skills**: Alchemy, Survival
- **Optional Skills**: Explosives, Insight, or Streetwise (depending on your role-playing or utility preference)

This mix will keep your Barbarian effective in combat while allowing for some versatility in non-combat scenarios. Athletics and Intimidate are your primary focus, while Alchemy and Survival offer solid support, allowing you to adapt to various situations inside and outside of battle.
